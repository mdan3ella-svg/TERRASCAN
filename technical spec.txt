TERRASCAN | TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION v1.0

1. System Overview

TERRASCAN is a client-side spatial analysis application built on the Three.js WebGL library. It is designed to perform real-time structural and geological evaluations without the need for server-side pre-processing, utilizing the user's GPU for high-concurrency spatial calculations.

2. Architectural Stack

Rendering Engine: Three.js (r128) utilizing a Logarithmic Depth Buffer to handle massive scale differences between fine structural details and large topographic meshes.

Coordinate System: EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) mapping projected onto a localized Cartesian grid.

Physics Engine: Custom Finite Element Analysis (FEA) solver using linear interpolation for stress-strain visualization.

UI/UX: Tailwind CSS for responsive, low-latency control panels.

3. Data Ingestion & Serialization

3.1 BIM/IFC Processing

Parser: Simulated IFC STEP parser mapping Industry Foundation Classes to THREE.Group hierarchies.

OBJ Loader: Asynchronous ingestion of Wavefront OBJ files with automated normalization of vertex normals for engineering-grade shading.

Export: Serialization of scene entities into a valid ISO-10303-21 (IFC 2x3) STEP physical file format.

3.2 Volumetric Geology Logic

Terrain: Procedurally deformed PlaneGeometry using Perlin-style noise for elevation simulation.

Strata Layers: Volumetric BoxGeometry stacks with THREE.Plane clipping.

Sectioning: Real-time GPU clipping using renderer.localClippingEnabled to perform non-destructive spatial cross-sections.

4. Performance Benchmarks

LOD (Level of Detail): Native support for mesh density scaling.

Target FPS: 60fps on modern hardware with up to 1.5M polygons.

Memory Management: Automatic disposal of geometries and textures during scene purges to prevent memory leaks in long-running engineering sessions.

5. Security & Persistence

Local Storage: Project state serialization into JSON strings for session persistence via localStorage.

Privacy: 100% client-side execution; data never leaves the user’s local environment unless explicitly exported.
